## 1. Azure Functions (Triggers & Bindings)

### Overview
- **Azure Functions** – A fully managed serverless compute service in Azure that lets you run event-driven code without managing infrastructure. Supports a wide variety of triggers (HTTP, timers, storage events, queues, Service Bus, Event Grid, etc.) and bindings for easy integration with other Azure services.  
- **AWS Lambda** – AWS’s equivalent to Azure Functions. Runs code in response to events from AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, or custom triggers. Scales automatically and charges based on execution time and memory.  
- **GCP Cloud Functions** – Google’s serverless compute offering. Supports HTTP triggers, Pub/Sub messages, Cloud Storage changes, and Firebase events. Lightweight and designed for rapid event-driven execution.

### Comparison Table
| Feature | Azure Functions | AWS Lambda | GCP Cloud Functions |
|---------|----------------|------------|---------------------|
| Core Features | Event-driven serverless compute, wide trigger/binding support | Event-driven serverless compute, integrates deeply with AWS services | Event-driven compute with native GCP service integration |
| Triggers / Bindings | HTTP, Timer, Blob, Queue, Service Bus, Event Hub, Event Grid, Cosmos DB | S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, EventBridge, SQS, SNS, Step Functions | HTTP, Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage, Firebase, Firestore |

| Strengths | Rich trigger/binding library, great tooling in Visual Studio Code | Large AWS service integration ecosystem, strong performance tuning options | Easy Firebase integration, very simple to deploy |
| Weaknesses | Cold starts in Consumption Plan, Azure-centric | Cold starts, more limited language/runtime updates | Cold starts, fewer trigger types compared to Azure Functions |

**Narrative Analysis:**  
All three services can run code when something happens, but Azure Functions gives you the most trigger and binding options, so it’s very flexible if you work with different Azure tools. AWS Lambda works great inside the AWS ecosystem and is very reliable at scale. GCP Cloud Functions is simple and connects well with Firebase and other Google services, but it has fewer trigger types compared to Azure. If you’re already using Azure, Functions is the best fit. For AWS-focused projects, Lambda is the top choice, and for quick apps on Google’s platform, Cloud Functions works well.
